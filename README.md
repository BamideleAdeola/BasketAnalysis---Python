# Basket Analysis - Python Project  

## Project Description  
Basket analysis is a key technique used in retail and e-commerce to identify associations between items frequently bought together. 
This project applies **Association Rule Mining** using the **Apriori Algorithm** to discover purchasing patterns in transactional data.  

The insights from this analysis can help businesses:  
âœ… Improve product placement strategies  
âœ… Develop targeted marketing campaigns  
âœ… Optimize inventory management  
âœ… Enhance customer recommendations  

This project walks through **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), transaction encoding, and applying the Apriori algorithm** to extract meaningful insights.
